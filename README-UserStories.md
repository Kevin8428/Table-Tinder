# User Stories: Table Tinder app

Table Tinder is an innovative app that facilitates social and collaborative eating practices so that you never have to dine by yourself. The app is great for foodies who love to try new places but donâ€™t want to eat alone.  The app is also great for those who want a family- or banquet-style dining experience with a group of foodies.  The app works whether you want to dine with one person or a group. Create profile; select a restaurant; create an appointment; and let others dine with you.

We have identified four types of users who would most likely benefit by using the Table Tinder app.

1. Foodies
2. Single people
3. Couples who want to dine with other couples
4. Folks who want the banquet dining experience
